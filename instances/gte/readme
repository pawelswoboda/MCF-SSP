This directory contains a number of files of the form gte_bad.XXXXXX

These files are instances of a minimum-cost flow problem on a
particular 49 node graph.  The instances differ in the choice of
capacities and demands.  We ran these problems using the RELAXT-III
code of Bertsekas and Tseng.  The interesting thing that happened was
the running times varied greatly.  A file with the name gte_bad.XXXX
represents a graph which took XXXX milliseconds.  These seems to be
bad examples for the RELAXT-III code, it would be interesting to see
how other minimum-cost flow code performed on these problems.

These problems came about as subproblems in the multicommodity flow
code of Leong, Shor, and Stein.
